# Work in progress
## SpectrumUC API & Web front end 

Twitter bot and api for the UC Campus mood lighting project (SpectrumUC) by UC Student Developer Organisation

Current maintainer @robodair

`npm install` to get dependencies

`npm start` to run a local instance

## TODO
- Set restrictions on endpoints so we can't get DDOSed as easily
- Learn Websockets or use longpolling or a similar technology so that browser pages can be updated in close to real time
